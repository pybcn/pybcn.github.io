I'm a big data engineer and occasional contributor for Spark (especially PySpark). I have a PhD in Mathematics, and moved to data engineering where I work mostly with Python and Scala designing and implementing big data pipelines in London and Barcelona. I have a personal blog called [mostlymaths](https://mostlymaths.net), where I almost never write about Maths.
