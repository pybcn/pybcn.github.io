​
I work across the data spectrum in many places, from big data processing using tools such as Apache Spark, to training Machine Learning models and visualizing their outputs, using tools such as scikit-learn or tensorflow.
​

I am a nerd about pandas and numpy and I am very interested in TDD and Functional Programming.
Python is where I am most at home, but I am also very interested in SQL, Scala and Haskell for a
variety of reasons.

​
I have a [blog](https://ber2.github.io) where I sometimes write technical posts as a way to synthesize and capture stuff that I have discovered while coding.
