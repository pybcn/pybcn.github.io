As an experienced IT Architect based in Barcelona, I specialise in seamlessly integrating Test Engineering and Backend expertise. My diverse background spans significant companies, with a notable focus on the health sector, where my determination lies in creating resilient data platform test strategies, particularly in the realm of ETL testing. Beyond the tech realm, my passion extends to teaching at Pompeu Fabra University, where I have the privilege of nurturing the next generation of IT professionals. Armed with a wealth of knowledge in DevOps, backend development, cloud computing, and comprehensive testing methodologies, I am committed to ensuring product quality and driving excellence in every aspect of my work.
