I've worked on large, multinational projects for nearly 30 years, beginning as a developer (with COBOL, VB, and Java) and transitioning to Database Engineering over the last 20 years, where I started my DBA career with Oracle and SQL Server.  In 2015, I shifted my focus primarily to PostgreSQL. From 2017 to 2021, I led a team responsible for migrating thousands of Oracle databases from a vast, global "private cloud" environment to PostgreSQL in the "public cloud," spanning multiple data centers in the US, EU, Singapore, Australia, and Korea.
In February 2021, I joined Adyen at their headquarters in Amsterdam, focusing on some exceptionally large PostgreSQL installations.  In Sept 2022 I joined Gartner in Barcelona to lead multiple DBA teams based in US, Europe and India, this was a very exciting role and I loved living in Barcelona. However after a year, I had to move to Madrid for family/health reasons and so decided to return to Adyen who have a new Tech Hub in Madrid. 

I'm a dedicated PostgreSQL enthusiast and appreciate the outstanding support from the PostgreSQL community, regularly attending events like pgconf.eu and FOSDEM. I've also presented to the Postgres NL user group.  I'm also interested in other open-source databases, including MySQL, SQLite, Redis, and Cassandra.

Looking ahead, I'm eager to revitalize the PostgreSQL Spain user group events in 2024, with PUG meetups now running in both Madrid and Barcelona.

Lastly, I make music with my husband, Thomasâ€”check us out on Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/artist/5WxyzA8hMS20lpnCGP3eCb)! We even have special pgconf/pgday songs for Amsterdam (LowLands) and Athens.
