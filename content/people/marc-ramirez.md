I’m a data engineer and technology enthusiast with over 9 years of experience designing and building data systems for companies like Billy Mobile, LIDL, and IntentHQ. Currently, I work as a Senior Data Engineer at Pitch.com, managing the entire data lifecycle with a focus on problem-solving. I’m obsessed with learning and love trying new approaches to push the boundaries of what’s possible in data engineering.
