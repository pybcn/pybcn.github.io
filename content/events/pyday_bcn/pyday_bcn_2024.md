<b>IZI Record, revolutionizing the camera app</b></br>
<i>Ferran Jovell </i>
<p><q>What we do at izi? How do we generate videos from different sources? How does it all work?!</q></p>

<b>A solution to store, catalog and visualize images using Django and Django Rest Framework. </b></br>
<i>Josep Sitjar Suñer</i>
<p><q>KeepYourPhoto (https://keepyourphoto.com) is a personal project developed with Django (Python) on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend, created in my free time to store, catalog and share photos. 
<br><br>
During the last 5 years, since my daughter was born, our family has been accumulating gigabytes of images. Especially  when she started kindergarten, the amount of images increased exponentially, as we’ve received a catalog of hundred of images for each activity they did. And of course, we want to keep all them as a treasure. 
<br><br>
First, we exhausted the available free space of providers like Google Drive or Dropbox. Then we start paying some basic plans. But in order to keep control of all these  images, and implement custom functions to catalog and to share them with other members of the family, I decided to create my own solution. 
<br><br>
I’ve developed a web application, with Django on the backend. The images are stored on AWS S3, and served with Cloudfront to increase the speed and security of access to them. Django-storages has been a good ally to implement that.   
<br>
In order to create the API, I’ve been using the Django Rest Framework, and as I work in the geospatial sector (as web map developer) it was mandatory to geolocate all the images with coordinates in their metadata. In that sense, I’ve been using GeoDjango. 
<br><br>
The platform is not completely finished, as I try to implement new functionalities in my free time. But It’s working as expected. It’s possible to create albums, massively upload images to them, visualize the images through a gallery carousel, delete albums and images, and visualize over a map the photos with coordinates on their  metadata. 
<br><br>
I’ve received interest from other people, and now I’m trying to make it available to them. The self- registry is working, but it is not yet a payment solution to afford the storage costs at AWS. 
<br><br>
During the talk, my idea is to present the tool and the technological solutions to implement it.</q></p>

    title: "Typing and pattern matching in Python"
    description: "Since 2014, with the introduction of type hints in Python 3.5, Python has been adding support to types while still maintaining its dynamic nature. Later, in Python 3.10, pattern matching was added to Python, which provides a powerful way to match data structures based on their types and values, improving Python’s capability to work with typed data. Both type hints and pattern matching help make code more predictable and robust. In this talk, we’ll answer the following questions: **Introduction to types in Python**: what's a type? which types does python have? What do they mean? **The basics of type hints**: how to define a type hint?  **mypy**: how to use mypy to check that your code does what you expect? **Advanced type hints**: how to define complex type hints? how to define your own types? how to use generic types? **Data validation**: how to use Pydantic and dataclasses for data validation? **Pattern matching**: how to use pattern matching together with type hints to write cleaner and more maintainable code. By the end of this talk, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to use type hints effectively and why they’re a valuable tool in any Python developer’s toolkit"

<p><q>Fa uns anys es va engegar la iniciativa Scientific Python, amb l'objectiu d'enfortir la col·laboració entre llibreries de Python en el camp de la computació científica. En els 5 minuts intentaré explicar què és i algunes de les seves iniciatives principals, que van des de gestió de dependències a consells d'accessibilitat passant per traduccions, 'nightly builds' o governança.</q></p>

<b>DrugScope: a ML-based platform for drug discovery</b></br>
<i>Verónica Larroy</i>
<p><q>DrugScope is a machine learning-powered tool designed to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to specific proteins, aiming to accelerate drug discovery and reduce costs. Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the project models molecular structures as graphs, with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. A public dataset from Leash Biosciences, containing around 300 million molecules and their interactions with three key proteins (HSA, BRD4, and SEH), was used for model training.
<br><br>
The project involved developing three separate GNN models, one for each protein, to capture the unique molecular interactions relevant to each target. Features for atoms and bonds were extracted using RDKit, and the data was prepared for training by converting these features into graph structures. The models were deployed using FastAPI, allowing researchers to input molecule data and receive predictions on binding affinity, potentially helping speed up the early stages of drug development.</q></p>

<b>Can LLMs Power Product Recommendations?</b></br>
<i>Babaniyi Olaniyi</i>
<p><q>I will discuss the use of large language models (LLMs) for product recommendation systems, leveraging their natural language understanding capabilities to predict items a user might purchase given their historical product reviews and purchases.</q></p>

<b>Pixel2Mechanics: Automated Biomechanical Simulations of High-Resolution Intervertebral Discs from Anisotropic MRIs</b></br>
<i>Sai Natarajan</i>
<p><q>This study presents Pixel2Mechanics, an automated pipeline for generating patient-specific biomechanical finite element (FE) models of lumbar intervertebral discs (IVD) from clinical MRI data. It utilizes a deep learning framework to create high-resolution meshes of the Annulus Fibrosus (AF) and Nucleus Pulposus (NP) across L1-L2 to L4-L5. The pipeline features a novel optimization method based on differentiable rendering and a Bayesian Coherent Point Drift++ morphing algorithm for volumetric FE meshes that maintain tissue topology. Load simulations validate the models against manual segmentation, demonstrating potential for clinical integration in diagnosing and treating IVD degeneration.</q></p>

## About PyDay BCN 2024

We are excited to announce the **8th edition** of PyDay in Barcelona!

PyDay is an event packed with FREE **python-related workshops** and activities for the Python community. It is organized once per year. Over the <a href="#previous_editions_section">last seven editions</a>, PyDay has become a fantastic opportunity to share our love for Python and engage users, companies, and newcomers!

#### When and where

It is scheduled for **Saturday 9th November** at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uxiao2Dr7uio9o3v9" target="_blank">Canòdrom</a>, from 9:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. CET, approximately.

#### A full day of in-person, hands-on workshops

PyDay BCN 2024 will have different **thematic tracks** --e.g. data science, web development, security-- with hands-on workshops lasting about 90 minutes. Participants will learn how to use different libraries, tools and techniques, fully guided by community members and support volunteers.

#### Participate in Kahoot and win prizes!

We will host a Kahoot game with questions about PyBCN and Python in general, with prizes for the fastest players. Will you miss it?!
