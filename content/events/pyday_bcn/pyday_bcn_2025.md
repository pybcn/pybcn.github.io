## About PyDay BCN 2025

We are excited to announce the **9th edition** of PyDay in Barcelona!

PyDay is an event packed with FREE **Python-related workshops** and activities for the Python community. It is organized once per year. Over the <a href="#previous_editions_section">last eight editions</a>, PyDay has become a fantastic opportunity to share our love for Python and engage users, companies, and newcomers!

#### When and where

It is scheduled for **Saturday 29th November** at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uxiao2Dr7uio9o3v9" target="_blank">Canòdrom</a>, from 9:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. CET, approximately.

#### A full day of in-person, hands-on workshops

PyDay BCN 2025 will have different **thematic tracks** --e.g. data science, web development, security-- with hands-on workshops lasting about 90 minutes. Participants will learn how to use different libraries, tools and techniques, fully guided by community members and support volunteers.

#### Participate in Kahoot and win prizes!

We will host a Kahoot game with questions about PyBCN and Python in general, with prizes for the fastest players. Will you miss it?!
