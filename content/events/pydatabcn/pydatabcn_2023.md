## About PyDataBCN 2023

We are thrilled to announce the creation of PyDataBCN, our new annual event dedicated to bringing together the Data Engineering and Data Science community working with Python in Barcelona. PyDataBCN aims to provide a platform for knowledge-sharing, networking, and learning for professionals, enthusiasts, and students alike.

PyDataBCN will offer free hands-on workshops, lightning talks, and lots of fun activities. The `workshops` will be conducted by community members and will cover a range of topics related to data science, data engineering, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn new skills, get insights into the latest trends and best practices, and interact with like-minded individuals. The `lightning talks` will feature short and impactful presentations by speakers from academia and industry, who will share their experiences, insights, and perspectives on various topics related to data science and engineering. These talks will be followed by Q&A sessions, where attendees can ask questions and engage with the speakers.

In addition to the workshops and lightning talks, PyDataBCN will also host various fun activities, including `networking` events, `Kahoot` games, and more. We believe that learning should be enjoyable and that attendees should have the opportunity to connect and engage with each other in a relaxed and informal setting.

PyDataBCN is a free non-profit event and is open to everyone, regardless of their level of experience or background. We encourage students, professionals, and enthusiasts to join us and become part of the vibrant and growing community of data scientists and engineers in Barcelona.

We look forward to seeing you at PyDataBCN and sharing our passion for Python, data science, and engineering!
