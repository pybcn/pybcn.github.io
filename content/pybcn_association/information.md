After 10 years of experience organizing python-related events and more than 3000 members on Meetup, **Python Barcelona (PyBCN)** was officially registered as a non-profit association in 2018. PyBCN is a meeting point for all the Barcelona Python community, and we organize different monthly activities like [PyBCN and PyLadiesBCN meetups and practice sessions](../../events/monthly_events), along with some annual events like [PyDay BCN](../../events/pyday_bcn/pyday_bcn_2020) or [PyDataBCN](../../events/other_events/pydata_bcn_2017/).


Would you like to be a part of PyBCN? We are looking forward to hearing from you!

We have a Management Board and a Standing Committee to make decisions, and work groups  to drive all the association activity.

* **Management Board**
   * President: Laura Pérez-Mayos
   * Secretary: Natàlia Padilla
   * Treasurer: Mireia Álvarez
* **Standing Committee**: It is mostly a consultive board and help coordinate the work groups.

   * **Meetup**: This work group organizes, prepares, coordinates and runs the PyBCN meetups every month.
   * **PyLadies**: They have been running the monthly PyLadies BCN workshops and activities.
   * **Practice Sessions**: This work group have been running the monthly PyBCN workshops and dojos.

   * **Video**: This work group is responsible for the recording of the talks in our meetups and activities and the publishing in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEhI2CfdT5--TYq47K4en4A" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>.
   * **Other work groups**: Some work groups are formed to run a specific event, like the PyDays.

All the work groups must follow some rules:
   
  * Every work group must have Chair, who will be accountable for the work group work to the Standing Committee.
  * The Chair is chosen by the work group members, who must be member of the Standing Committee.
  * At least two members of the Standing Committee must be part of every work group.
  * Nobody can participate in more than three work groups.
  * There's no other requirement to be a member of any work group.
