After 10 years of experience organizing python-related events and more than 3000 members on Meetup, **Python Barcelona (PyBCN)** was officially registered as a non-profit association in 2018. PyBCN is a meeting point for all the Barcelona Python community, and we organize different monthly activities like [PyBCN and PyLadiesBCN meetups and practice sessions](../../events/monthly_events), along with some annual events like [PyDay BCN](../../events/pyday_bcn/pyday_bcn_2022) or [PyDataBCN](../../events/pydatabcn/pydatabcn_2023/).


Would you like to be a part of PyBCN? We are looking forward to hearing from you!

All the work groups must follow some rules:
